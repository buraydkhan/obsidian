# 1. SDLC
 🌐 **SDLC – Software Development Life Cycle**
**SDLC** is the structured process followed to develop high-quality software. It defines the stages involved in software development from planning to maintenance. Each phase has specific goals and deliverables.
## 1.1 🔄 **Phases of SDLC**:
1. **Requirement Gathering & Analysis**
    - Understand what the users need.
    - Define project scope and goals.
2. **System Design**
    - Plan software architecture, interfaces, data flow, and UI/UX.    
3. **Implementation (Coding)**
    - Developers write the actual code based on the design.        
4. **Testing**
    - Test the software for bugs, errors, and performance issues.    
5. **Deployment**
    - Release the software to users or the market.    
6. **Maintenance**
    - Fix bugs, add features, and improve performance after release.    
> 📝 **Goal**: To ensure a disciplined, predictable, and repeatable software process.

# 2. SRS
 📄 **SRS – Software Requirements Specification**
**SRS** is a formal document that clearly describes what the software will do and how it will perform. It is created during the **Requirement Gathering** phase of SDLC.
## 2.1 ✍️ **What SRS Contains**:
1. **Introduction**
    - Purpose, scope, definitions, and references.    
2. **Overall Description**    
    - User needs, product perspective, assumptions, and constraints.    
3. **Specific Requirements**
    - Functional Requirements: What the system **should do** (features, inputs/outputs).  
    - Non-Functional Requirements: How the system **should behave** (performance, security, usability).
4. **External Interface Requirements**
    - Interaction with hardware, software, users, or other systems.

> 📘 **Example**:  
> Functional: "The system shall allow users to log in with a username and password."  
> Non-Functional: "The login process shall not take more than 2 seconds."

# 3. 🧠 Why SDLC and SRS Matter

- **SDLC** gives structure to the software development process.
- **SRS** ensures all stakeholders have a clear and agreed-upon understanding of what the software must do.
