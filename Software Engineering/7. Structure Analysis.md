# 1. Introduction
**Structured Analysis (SA)** is a **methodical way of analyzing and modeling a system** before building it. It’s mainly used in **traditional (non-object-oriented)** software engineering — especially in the **Waterfall Model** — to break down complex systems into simpler parts.
## 1.1 Goal of this
- **What** the system should do (not how to do it).
- The **flow of data** and **functional requirements**.
- How to organize requirements into **clear diagrams and documentation**.

# 2. Key Features
1. 📌 **DFD (Data Flow Diagram)**
    - Shows how **data moves** through the system.
    - Elements:
        - **Processes**: Transform data.    
        - **Data stores**: Hold data.
        - **External entities**: People/systems that interact.
        - **Data flows**: Arrows showing movement of data.
            
2. 📄 **Data Dictionary**
    - A table that defines **all data elements** used in the system.
    - Describes data types, structures, meanings, etc.
        
3. 📦 **Process Specification (P-Spec)**
    - Describes what each **process** in the DFD does (inputs, outputs, logic).
        
4. 🧭 **Structured English**
    - A way to write logic using simple English mixed with programming-like control structures (like IF, ELSE, WHILE).
        
5. 🔄 **Decision Trees and Tables**
    - Help visualize and simplify **complex decision-making logic**.

# 3. Usage
🧱 **Why Use Structured Analysis?*
- Gives a **clear, logical structure** before coding.
- Focuses on **processes and data**, so it's easy to spot errors early.
- Makes it easier for teams to understand and maintain the system.
- Works well for **big, stable systems** (like banking or inventory software).
# 4.✅ **Advantages**
- Well-organized documentation.
- Great for **non-object-oriented systems**.
- Helps detect errors and missing requirements early.
- Easy to teach and follow.
# 5.❌ **Disadvantages**
- Doesn’t support **object-oriented design** (used in modern systems).
- Too rigid for systems with **frequent changes**.
- Can become too complex for **large-scale systems**.
