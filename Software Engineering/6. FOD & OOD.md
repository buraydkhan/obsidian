# 🧮 1. **Function-Oriented Design (FOD)**

## 1.1🧠 What is it?
Function-Oriented Design focuses on **functions** (actions or steps).  
The program is built around **what it needs to do**.
## 1.2🧱 Structure:
- Break the whole program into **functions**
- Functions operate on **data**
- Data is **shared**, not protected
## 1.3🧾 Example:
Imagine you're writing a program to manage a **library**.
In Function-Oriented Design, you might have:
- `addBook()`
- `searchBook()`
- `issueBook()`
- `returnBook()`
Each function takes data (like book name or user ID) and processes it.
## 1.4📌 Key Points:
- Focus is on **what the system does**
- Code is split into **functions**
- Data is passed around between functions
# 🧱 2. **Object-Oriented Design (OOD)**

## 2.1🧠 What is it?
Object-Oriented Design focuses on **objects** (real-world entities).  
The program is built around **who is doing it** and **what they own**.
## 2.2🧱 Structure:
- Break the program into **objects** (like Book, User, Library)
- Objects have **data (variables)** and **functions (methods)**
- Each object **manages its own data**
## 2.3🧾 Example (same library program):
You might have these **classes**:
- `Book` – has `title`, `author`, and a method `issueTo(user)`
- `User` – has `name`, `id`, and a method `borrow(book)`
- `Library` – manages the list of books
## 2.4📌 Key Points:
- Focus is on **objects/entities**
- Code is split into **classes**
- Data is **protected** inside objects (encapsulation)
# 3. ⚖️ Comparison Table:

|Feature|Function-Oriented Design|Object-Oriented Design|
|---|---|---|
|Main focus|Functions (actions)|Objects (entities)|
|Structure|Functions + shared data|Classes/Objects (data + methods)|
|Real-world modeling|Harder|Easier|
|Code reuse|Less|More (through inheritance)|
|Example|`issueBook(user, bookID)`|`user.issue(book)`|

# 4.🎯 Summary:
- Use **Function-Oriented Design** for **small, simple programs**
- Use **Object-Oriented Design** for **complex, real-world apps** (games, websites, apps, etc.)
