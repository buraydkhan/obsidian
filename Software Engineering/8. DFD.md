# 1. Introduction
A **DFD (Data Flow Diagram)** is a diagram used in **software engineering** to visually represent how **data flows** through a **system**, showing the **input**, **processing**, **output**, and **storage** of data.
# 2. Keys of DFD
- **Processes** (represented by circles or ovals)  
    â€“ These show **actions or operations** that transform data.  
    â€“ Example: `Process Order`, `Verify Login`.
- **Data Flows** (represented by arrows)  
    â€“ These show **movement of data** between parts of the system.  
    â€“ Example: `Customer Info`, `Payment Details`.
- **Data Stores** (represented by open-ended rectangles or parallel lines)  
    â€“ These show where data is **stored for later use**.  
    â€“ Example: `Customer Database`, `Product List`.
- **External Entities** (represented by rectangles or squares)  
    â€“ These are **outside actors** (people, systems) that interact with the system.  
    â€“ Example: `Customer`, `Bank`, `Admin`.
# 3. DFD Levels
| Level                         | Description                                                                       |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Level 0 (Context Diagram)** | Shows the system as **one single process** with external entities and data flows. |
| **Level 1**                   | Breaks down the main process into **sub-processes** for better understanding.     |
| **Level 2+**                  | Further decomposes Level 1 processes into **more detailed steps**.                |

# 4. Example
âœ… **Example (Online Shopping System â€“ Level 0 DFD)**
**Entities:** Customer  
**Process:** Online Shopping System  
**Data Stores:** Order DB, Product DB  
**Flows:**
- Customer â†’ [Place Order] â†’ System
- System â†’ [Send Confirmation] â†’ Customer
- System â†” Order DB, Product DB
# 5. Usage
ðŸŽ¯ **Why Use a DFD?**
- Helps understand the **system structure** and **data movement**
- Useful for **system analysis**, **design**, and **communication**
- Makes it easier to **spot inefficiencies or missing elements**
