# 1. 💻 **Coding Standards in Software Engineering**

**Coding standards** are a set of **guidelines, rules, and best practices** used by developers to write code that is **consistent, readable, maintainable**, and **error-free** across a software project or organization.
# 2.🔧 **Why Are Coding Standards Important?**
1. ✅ **Improves code readability**
2. 🧩 **Makes code easier to maintain**
3. 👥 **Enables teamwork & collaboration**
4. 🐞 **Reduces bugs and improves quality**
5. 📈 **Helps in faster onboarding of new developers**

# 3. 🧱 **Common Coding Standard Guidelines**

|Category|Examples|
|---|---|
|**Naming Conventions**|Use `camelCase` for variables, `PascalCase` for classes, `UPPER_CASE` for constants|
|**Indentation**|Consistently use 2 or 4 spaces or tabs (never mix)|
|**Commenting**|Use clear and concise comments to explain complex logic|
|**Code Structure**|Keep functions small and focused on a single task|
|**Error Handling**|Always handle exceptions and edge cases properly|
|**DRY Principle**|Don't Repeat Yourself – reuse code where possible|
|**Version Control**|Use Git with meaningful commit messages|

# 4. 📘 **Example (in Python)**

```
`# GOOD (follows coding standards) def calculate_total(price, tax_rate):     """Calculate total price including tax."""  
return price + (price * tax_rate)`
```

```
`# BAD (no comments, poor naming) def calc(p, t):     return p + (p * t)`
```

# 5.🏷️ **Tools That Help Enforce Coding Standards**

- **Linters** (e.g., ESLint for JavaScript, Pylint for Python)
- **Formatters** (e.g., Prettier, Black)
- **Code Review** processes
- **CI/CD** tools with code quality checks

# 6. 🏁 Summary

|Good Practice|Example|
|---|---|
|Use meaningful names|`userAge` instead of `ua`|
|Keep code DRY|Avoid repeating the same code|
|Comment wisely|Explain why, not what|
|Follow naming rules|Use consistent naming styles|
|Use tools|Lint your code before pushing|
