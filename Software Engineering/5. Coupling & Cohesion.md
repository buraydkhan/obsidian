## 1. âœ… **Cohesion** â€“ _How well things inside a module/class belong together
### 1.1 ðŸ”¸ What it means:
- Cohesion measures how **focused** a module is on **one single task**.
- High cohesion = all parts of a module work together for one clear purpose.
### 1.2 ðŸ”¸ Example:
A class `Invoice` that:
- calculates invoice totals
- applies taxes
- and prints invoice
This is **high cohesion** â€“ everything is about invoicing.
But if the same class also sends emails and logs errors, it's **low cohesion** â€“ too many unrelated responsibilities.
### 1.3âœ… Good Design Goal:
> **High cohesion** â€“ each class or function should do **one thing well**.

## 2.ðŸ”— **Coupling** â€“ _How dependent modules/classes are on each other_
### 2.1ðŸ”¸ What it means:
- Coupling measures how **connected** different modules/classes are.
- Low coupling = modules are **independent**, easier to change/test.
### 2.2 ðŸ”¸ Example:
- If `UserProfile` class calls methods from `PaymentService`, and also reads its internal data, that's **tight coupling**.
- If it only communicates through interfaces or simple method calls, that's **loose (low) coupling**.
### 2.3âœ… Good Design Goal:
> **Low coupling** â€“ keep modules independent, so changing one doesnâ€™t break others.
## 3.ðŸ§  Summary Table:

|Concept|Goal|Good Example|Bad Example|
|---|---|---|---|
|Cohesion|High Cohesion|Class handles one well-defined job|Class handles unrelated tasks|
|Coupling|Low Coupling|Modules interact through interfaces|Modules directly depend on internals|

## 4.ðŸš€ Why They Matter:

- **Easier maintenance**
- **Better testing**
- **Faster development**
- **More flexible systems**
