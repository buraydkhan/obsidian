# Introduction to Wireshark
**WHAT IS WIRESHARK** ? 
Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer that captures and inspects packets in real time, making it an essential tool for cybersecurity professionals, network administrators, and ethical hackers. It allows users to analyze network traffic to troubleshoot issues, detect security threats, and monitor communications.
## 1. Key Features of Wireshark
1. **Real-time Packet Capture – Captures live network traffic.**
2. **Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) – Allows detailed analysis of packets.**
3. **Protocol Analysis – Supports hundreds of network protocols (TCP, UDP, HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, etc.).**
4. **Filtering & Searching – Users can filter packets based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols.**
5. **Decryption Support – Can decrypt certain encrypted traffic (like SSL/TLS with proper keys).**
6. **Color Coding & Graphical Analysis – Highlights packet types for easier readability.**
7. **Cross-platform – Available for Windows, Linux (including Kali Linux), and macOS.**
## 2. Working
Wireshark works by sniffing packets from a network interface (wired, wireless, or virtual) and displaying them in a structured format.
### 2.1 How Wireshark Captures Packets
1. Select a Network Interface – Users must select a network adapter (e.g., Wi-Fi, Ethernet) to monitor.
2. Start Packet Capture – Wireshark begins capturing all network packets passing through the selected interface.
3. Filter and Analyze Packets – Users apply filters to isolate specific traffic, such as HTTP requests or suspicious packets.
4. Inspect Packet Details – Each packet contains information such as source/destination addresses, protocol type, payload, and headers.
5. Save or Export Data – Users can save captured data for later analysis or reporting.
## 3. Understanding 
When you open Wireshark, you will see:
### 3.1 Main Components
1. Menu Bar – Contains options for file handling, capture, filters, statistics, and settings.
2. Toolbar – Provides quick access to essential functions like starting/stopping capture.
3. Packet List Pane – Displays captured packets in a tabular format with timestamps, protocol types, source/destination IPs, etc.
4. Packet Details Pane – Shows in-depth information about a selected packet, including headers and payloads.
5. Packet Bytes Pane – Displays raw packet data in hexadecimal and ASCII formats.
## 4. Packet Analysis with Wireshark
Once packets are captured, Wireshark allows deep analysis of their structure and contents.
### 4.1 Basic Packet Structure
Each captured packet consists of multiple layers:

1. **Ethernet Frame (Layer 2) – Contains MAC addresses and type of network protocol used.**
2. **IP Header (Layer 3) – Includes source and destination IP addresses.**
3. **Transport Layer (Layer 4) – Displays TCP/UDP headers, ports, and flags.**
4. **Application Layer (Layer 7) – Shows protocol data (e.g., HTTP request details, DNS queries).**

### 4.2 Filtering Traffic in Wireshark
Wireshark provides display filters to help focus on specific network traffic:
**ip.addr == 192.168.1.1 → Show packets involving this IP.**
**tcp.port == 80 → Show HTTP traffic (Port 80).**
**http.request → Show only HTTP requests.**
**udp → Show only UDP traffic.**

You can also use **capture filters** before starting a capture to limit what is collected:
host 192.168.1.100 → Capture only traffic to/from this IP.
port 443 → Capture only HTTPS traffic.
tcp → Capture only TCP packets.
## 5. Practical Uses of Wireshark
Wireshark is used for various purposes in networking, cybersecurity, and troubleshooting:
### 5.1 Network Troubleshooting
Detects slow or dropped packets.
Identifies misconfigured devices or protocols.
Diagnoses high latency or congestion issues.
### 5.2 Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking
Detecting Intrusions: Analyzing traffic for signs of hacking (e.g., brute-force attacks, malware).
Packet Sniffing: Intercepting unencrypted traffic for analysis.
Forensic Analysis: Investigating security incidents and breaches.
### 5.3 Website & Application Analysis
Monitoring HTTP/HTTPS requests and responses.
Identifying server response times and errors.
Debugging API calls.
### 5.4 Wi-Fi Network Monitoring
Capturing packets over wireless networks to analyze SSID broadcasts, authentication requests, and encryption methods.
Ethical Considerations & Legal Issues
**Wireshark is a powerful tool, but capturing traffic without permission is illegal in many places. Always follow these ethical guidelines**: ✅ Use Wireshark only on networks you own or have authorization to analyze.
✅ Do not capture sensitive or private data (such as login credentials).
✅ Be aware of data privacy laws (such as GDPR, CCPA).

## 6. How to Install Wireshark on Kali Linux
Wireshark is pre-installed in Kali Linux, but if needed, you can install or update it using:
`sudo apt update && sudo apt install wireshark`
To run Wireshark with root privileges:

```
sudo wireshark
```
For non-root users, add your account to the wireshark group:
```
sudo usermod -aG wireshark $USER
```
Then restart your system and launch Wireshark without sudo.

8. Advanced Wireshark Features
9. Decrypting Encrypted Traffic
Wireshark can decrypt certain encrypted protocols (SSL/TLS) if you have the necessary keys.

10. Exporting Data for Analysis
Captured packets can be saved in .pcap format for later analysis with other tools.

3. Command-line Alternative: TShark
Wireshark provides a CLI tool called TShark for packet capture and analysis:


```
tshark -i eth0 -w capture.pcap
```

Wireshark is an indispensable tool for network analysis, security assessments, and troubleshooting. Mastering its filtering, capture, and analysis techniques can help both cybersecurity professionals and network administrators gain deep insights into network traffic.
