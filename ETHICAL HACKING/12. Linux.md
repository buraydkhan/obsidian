# Introduction to Linux
**WHAT IS LINUX** ?
Linux is an open-source operating system (OS) that is based on Unix. It is widely used for servers, desktops, embedded systems, and mobile devices. Linux is known for its stability, security, and flexibility.
## 1. Key Features 
- **Open-source**: The source code is freely available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute.
- **Multi-user & Multitasking**: Multiple users can work on the system at the same time, and it can handle multiple tasks simultaneously.
- **Highly Customizable**: Users can choose from different desktop environments, package managers, and kernel configurations.
- **Secure & Stable**: It has strong security features and is less prone to viruses compared to other operating systems.
- **Free to Use**: Most Linux distributions (distros) are free, unlike proprietary OSs like Windows or macOS.
### 1.1 Cool Features
#### 1.1.1üî• **Customization & Control**
