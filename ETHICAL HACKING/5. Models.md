# Introduction to Models
## 1. OSI MODEL
**WHAT IS OSI MODEL** ? 
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a communication system into seven layers. It helps in understanding and designing network architectures by breaking down networking functions into manageable parts. It works top to bottom. 
 It Standardizes networking communication.
Helps troubleshoot network issues by identifying which layer is failing.
Ensures interoperability between different vendors' hardware and software.
## 2. Working
The 7 Layers of the OSI Model:
### 2.1 Physical Layer (Layer 1)
Deals with the physical connection between devices.
Responsible for transmitting raw bits (0s and 1s) over a medium (e.g., cables, wireless signals).
Example: Ethernet cables, fiber optics, radio waves.
### 2.2 Data Link Layer (Layer 2)
Manages the direct communication between connected devices.
Handles error detection, correction, and MAC (Media Access Control) addressing.
Example: Switches, MAC addresses, PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol).
### 2.3 Network Layer (Layer 3)
Responsible for routing and forwarding data between different networks.
Uses IP (Internet Protocol) addresses to determine paths.
Example: Routers, IP addresses, ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol).
### 2.4 Transport Layer (Layer 4)
Ensures complete data transfer between devices.
Uses protocols like TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) to manage connections.
Example: TCP for reliable communication, UDP for fast but unreliable data transfer (e.g., streaming).
### 2.5 Session Layer (Layer 5)
Manages sessions (connections) between applications.
Ensures continuous data exchange and session recovery after interruptions.
Example: APIs, login sessions, RPC (Remote Procedure Call).
### 2.6 Presentation Layer (Layer 6)
Translates and formats data for applications.
Handles encryption, compression, and encoding.
Example: SSL/TLS for encryption, JPEG/MP3 for file formats.
### 2.7 Application Layer (Layer 7)
Provides services that applications use to communicate over a network.
Examples: HTTP (web browsing), FTP (file transfer), SMTP (email).
## 3. TCP/IP MODEL
**WHAT IS TCP/IP MODEL**
The TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) Model is a more practical and widely used networking framework compared to the OSI model. It simplifies communication between devices over the internet and consists of four layers instead of seven.
## 4. Working (TCP/IP Model)
4 Layers of the TCP/IP Model
### 4.1 Network Access Layer (Link Layer)
Corresponds to the Physical & Data Link layers of the OSI model.
Handles hardware addressing (MAC), device-to-device data transfer, and error detection.
Includes technologies like Ethernet, WiFi, ARP (Address Resolution Protocol), PPP.
Example: A router sending data over a fiber optic cable.
### 4.2 Internet Layer
Corresponds to the Network layer of the OSI model.
Responsible for routing data packets between devices across networks.
Uses logical addressing via IP (IPv4 & IPv6), ICMP (for error reporting), and ARP.
Example: A router forwarding data using an IP address.
### 4.3 Transport Layer
Corresponds to the Transport layer of the OSI model.
Ensures reliable or fast data transmission between devices.
Uses:
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) – Reliable, connection-oriented (e.g., web browsing, emails).
UDP (User Data gram Protocol) – Fast, connection less (e.g., video streaming, gaming).
Example: A web page loading using TCP or a YouTube video streaming via UDP.
### 4.4 Application Layer
Combines Application, Presentation, and Session layers from the OSI model.
Provides services for end-user applications like web browsing, emails, and file transfers.
Uses protocols like:
HTTP/HTTPS (Web Browsing)
FTP (File Transfer)
SMTP/POP3/IMAP (Email)
DNS (Domain Name System)
Example: Visiting a website using HTTPS or sending an email using SMTP.

## 5. OSI VS TCP/IP Model

| FEATURE      | 7 LAYERS (OSI MODEL)                                 | 4 LAYERS (TCP/IP MODEL)    |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| COMPLEXITY   | MORE DETAILED                                        | SIMPLER AND WIDELY USED    |
| LAYERS       | 7                                                    | 4                          |
| DEVELOPED BY | ISO (International Organization for Standardization) | U.S. Department of Defense |
| USAGE        | CONCEPTUAL REFERENCE                                 | PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION   |
## 6. Importance
**Why is the TCP/IP Model Important**?
Backbone of the Internet: Used in real-world networking.
Standardized Communication: Ensures different devices and networks can communicate.
Simplified Architecture: More practical compared to the OSI model.
