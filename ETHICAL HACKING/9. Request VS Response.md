# Introduction to Request
A request is when a client (like a web browser or app) asks a server for data or services. This happens over the internet using different protocols, like HTTP/HTTPS for websites or DNS for domain lookups.
## 1. Types of Requests in Web Communication:
### 1.1 HTTP Requests (Used for websites)
Sent by browsers when you visit a website.
Includes different methods:
#### 1.1.1 GET
‚Äì Retrieves data (e.g., loading a webpage).
#### 1.1.2 POST
‚Äì Sends data (e.g., submitting a form).
#### 1.1.3 PUT
‚Äì Updates existing data.
#### 1.1.4 DELETE
‚Äì Removes data.
### 1.2 DNS Requests
(Used for domain name lookups)
When you enter example.com, a DNS request is made to find its IP address.
### 1.3 API Requests (Used for apps & services)
Apps communicate with servers using APIs.
Example: A weather app requests data from a weather API.
### 1.4 Database Requests 
(Used for retrieving data from databases)
Example: A website fetches your profile info from a database.
## 2. How a Request Works
(Example: Loading a Website)
You type example.com in your browser.
Your browser sends a DNS request to find the IP address.
A HTTP GET request is sent to that IP asking for the website.
The server responds with the webpage data.
Your browser renders the page for you to see.
## 3. Introduction to Response
A response is the reply sent by a server to a client (such as a web browser or app) after it receives a request. It contains the requested data or an error message if something goes wrong.
## 4 Types of Responses in Web Communication:

### 4.1 HTTP Responses (For websites)
Sent after a browser makes an HTTP request.
Includes:
#### 4.1.1 Status Code 
‚Äì Indicates success, failure, or redirection.
#### 4.1.2 Headers
‚Äì Provide extra info (e.g., content type, cookies).
#### 4.1.3 Body 
‚Äì Contains the actual data (HTML, JSON, images, etc.).
### 4.2 DNS Responses 
(For domain lookups)
When you request example.com, the DNS server responds with its IP address.
### 4.3 API Responses
(For apps & services)
When an app requests data from an API, the response contains structured data (usually in JSON or XML format).
### 4.4 Database Responses 
(For fetching stored data)
When a website requests user details, the database responds with the relevant records.
## 5. How a Response Works 
(Example: Loading a Website)
You type example.com in your browser.
Your browser sends a request to the server.
The server processes it and sends back a response with:
#### 5.1 Status Code: 
200 OK (Success).
#### 5.2 Headers: 
Content type, cache settings, etc.
#### 5.3 Body: 
The HTML content of the page.
Your browser renders the page for you to see.
## 6. Common HTTP Response Status Codes:
‚úÖ 200 OK ‚Äì Request was successful.
üîÑ 301 Moved Permanently ‚Äì URL has changed.
‚ùå 404 Not Found ‚Äì Page doesn‚Äôt exist.
üö´ 500 Internal Server Error ‚Äì Server issue.
## 7. Why Are Responses Important?
‚úÖ Deliver requested data to users.
‚úÖ Indicate errors when something goes wrong.
‚úÖ Power websites, apps, and APIs.

## 8. Types of Request Methods

| REQUEST METHODS | DEFINITION                                                                               |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET             | DATA TRANSFER THROUGH URL EASILY VISIBLE AND NOT SECURE                                  |
| HEAD            | SAME AS GET, BUT TRANSFER THE STATUS LINE AND HEADER SECTION ONLY                        |
| POST            | SENDS USER INFORMATION & FILES IN BODY, TO SERVER USING HTML FORMS                       |
| PUT             | REPLACES ALL THE CURRENT REPRESENTATION OF THE TARGET RESOURCE WITH THE UPLOADED CONTENT |
| DELETE          | REMOVES ALL THE CURRENT REPRESENTATION OF THE TARGET RESOURCE GIVEN BY A URL             |
| OPTION          | DESCRIBE THE COMMUNICATION OPTIONS FOR THE TARGET RESOURCE                               |
| TRACE           | PERFORMS A MESSAGE LOOP-BACK TEST ALONG THE PATH TO TARGET RESOURCE                      |
| CONNECT         | ESTABLISH A TUNNEL TO THE SERVER IDENTIFIED BY A GIVEN URL                               |
