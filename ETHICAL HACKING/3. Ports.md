## 1. PORT IN NETWORKING 
### 1.1 What is a Port?
A port is a 16-bit number (0â€“65535) that allows multiple applications to send and receive data on a single device. It works alongside an IP address to ensure that network traffic reaches the correct service.
IP Address: Identifies the device.
Port Number: Identifies the specific application or service.
For example:
ðŸ“Œ 192.168.1.1:80 â†’ Sends traffic to a web server running on port 80.
### 1.2 Types of Ports
A. Well-Known Ports (0â€“1023)
Used by standard protocols and services:
Port 80 â€“ HTTP (Web browsing)
Port 443 â€“ HTTPS (Secure web browsing)
Port 25 â€“ SMTP (Email sending)
Port 22 â€“ SSH (Secure remote access)
B. Registered Ports (1024â€“49151)
Used by specific applications assigned by IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority).
**Port 3306 â€“ MySQL database**
**Port 3389 â€“ Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)**
**C. Dynamic/Private Ports (49152â€“65535)**
**Used temporarily by client applications for communication (also called ephemeral ports).**
**Assigned dynamically when a client starts a network session.**
**Example: When you browse a website, your browser uses a random port (e.g., 49160) to connect to port 443 on the web server.**
### 1.3 How Ports Work in Communication
A client (e.g., web browser) requests a service by specifying an IP and port (e.g., google.com:443).
A server listens on that port for incoming requests.
Data is transmitted between client and server through these ports.
Example:
ðŸ”¹ You enter www.google.com â†’ Browser connects to Google's IP on port 443 (HTTPS).
ðŸ”¹ Your computer uses a random port (e.g., 49200) to receive data back.
### 1.4 Port Security & Firewalls
Firewalls control which ports are open or blocked to prevent unauthorized access.
Port scanning tools (like Nmap) can detect open ports for security audits.
Common attacks:
Port scanning attacks â€“ Hackers look for open ports to exploit vulnerabilities.
DDoS attacks â€“ Overloading a port with excessive traffic to disrupt a service.
