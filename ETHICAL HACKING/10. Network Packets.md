# Introduction to Network Packets
**WHAT IS NETWORK PACKETS** ?
Network packets are small units of data that are transmitted over a network, such as the internet or a local network. When data (like a web page, email, or video) is sent from one computer to another, it’s broken down into smaller chunks called packets because it’s easier and more efficient to send data this way.
## 1. Key Components of a Network Packet
Each packet contains three main parts:
1. Header: Contains control information, such as:
**Source and destination IP addresses (where the packet is coming from and where it's going)**
**Packet number (so the receiver can reassemble the data in the correct order)**
**Protocol information (e.g., TCP or UDP)**
1. Payload: The actual data being transferred, such as part of a file, image, or message.
2. Trailer (or Footer): Contains error-checking information like a checksum, which helps ensure that the packet wasn't corrupted during transmission.
## 2. How Network Packets Work
Breaking down data: When you send data, it’s divided into multiple packets.
Routing: Each packet may take different routes through the network to reach its destination. Routers and switches help direct them.
Reassembly: The receiving computer or server collects the packets and reassembles them in the correct order.
Error checking: If any packets are missing or corrupted, the receiver can request them again.
## 3. Why Use Packets?
Efficiency: Small packets reduce the chance of clogging the network.
Error Handling: Easier to detect and fix problems with small chunks.
Flexibility: Packets can travel via different routes and still reach the same destination.
