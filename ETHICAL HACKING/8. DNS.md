# Introduction to Domain Name System
**WHAT IS DOMAIN NAME** ?
A domain name is the unique web address that people use to access a website. It serves as an easy-to-remember alternative to a website’s numerical IP address. For example, instead of typing "192.168.1.1", users can simply type "example.com".
## 1. Domain Name System
DNS (Domain Name System) is like the internet’s phonebook. It translates human-readable domain names (e.g., example.com) into IP addresses (e.g., 192.168.1.1) that computers use to locate websites and services.
### 1.1 How DNS Works:
#### 1.1.1 User Requests a Website
You type example.com into a browser.
#### 1.1.2 DNS Query is Sent
The browser asks a DNS server for the corresponding IP address.
#### 1.1.3 DNS Resolving
The DNS system finds the IP address through a series of steps.
#### 1.1.4 Website Loads 
The browser connects to the server, and the website appears.
### 1.2 Key Components of DNS:
#### 1.2.1 DNS Resolver 
The first stop in a DNS lookup (usually provided by your internet provider).
#### 1.2.2 Root Name Servers 
Directs requests to the correct top-level domain (TLD) servers.
#### 1.2.3 TLD Name Servers
Handles extensions like .com, .net, .org and forwards requests.
#### 1.2.4 Authoritative Name Server 
The final stop that holds the actual IP address of the website.
## 2. Records in DNS & there use

| RECORDS | USE                                             |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| A       | IP OF DOMAIN NAME                               |
| CNAME   | FOWARDS DOMAIN AND SUB DOMAIN TO ANOTHER DOMAIN |
| MX      | DIRECTS MAIL TO EMAIL SERVER                    |
| TXT     | ANY TEXT BY ADMIN                               |
| NS      | NAME SERVER OF DNS SERVER                       |
| SOA     | ADMIN INFO ABOUT A DOMAIN                       |
| SRV     | SPECIFIC PORT FOR SPECIFIC SERVICE              |
| PTR     | PROVIDES DOMAIN NAME IN REVERSE-LOOKUPS         |

## 3. Zone Files
A zone file is a simple text file used by DNS servers to store information about a domain and its subdomains. It contains a series of DNS records that define how to route traffic for that domain.
**Key Components of a Zone File** :
### 3.1 SOA (Start of Authority) Record
The first record in a zone file.
Contains essential details about the domain, like the primary DNS server, contact email, and refresh times for other servers.
### 3.2 NS (Name Server) Records
Lists the authoritative DNS servers for the domain.
Example:
```
example.com.   IN   NS   ns1.example.com.  
A (Address) Records

```
### 3.3 A (Address) Records
Maps a domain to an IPv4 address.
Example:
```
www.example.com.   IN   A   192.168.1.1  
AAAA Records

```
### 3.4 AAAA Records 
Same as A records but for IPv6 addresses.
### 3.5 CNAME (Canonical Name) Records
Aliases one domain to another. Useful for subdomains.
Example:
```
blog.example.com. 
IN   CNAME   www.example.com.  
MX (Mail Exchange) Records
```
### 3.6 MX (Mail Exchange) Records
Directs email traffic by specifying the mail servers for a domain.
Example:
```
example.com
.   IN   MX   10   mail.example.com.  
TXT Records

```
### 3.7 TXT Records 
Stores text information for various uses like verification (e.g., SPF, DKIM).
Example:
```
example.com. 
IN   TXT   "v=spf1 include:
_spf.example.com ~all"  
PTR (Pointer) Records
```
### 3.8 PTR (pointer) Records 
Used for reverse DNS lookups (IP address to domain).
## 4. Why Are Zone Files Important?
Control DNS Settings — Define how traffic flows to your website, email, and services.
Security — Helps set up email authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) and protect against spoofing.
Scalability — Allows easy management of subdomains and IP mappings.
