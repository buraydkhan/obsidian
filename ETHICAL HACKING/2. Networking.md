# Introduction to Networking
## 1. NETWORKING
**WHAT IS NETWORKING** ?
Computer networking is the practice of connecting multiple computing devices to share resources, exchange data, and communicate with each other. Networks can range from small home setups to vast global infrastructures like the internet.

**HOW IT WORKS** ?
### 1.1 Data Creation & Packetization
When a user sends a request (e.g., loading a website), the data is broken into small units called packets. Each packet contains:
The source IP address (sender's device).
The destination IP address (receiver's device).
The actual data being transmitted.
Error-checking information for reliability.
### 1.2 Addressing & Routing
Each device on a network has an IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.1), which helps direct packets to the right destination. The Domain Name System (DNS) translates website names (e.g., google.com) into IP addresses.
If the data is within a local network (e.g., home WiFi), a router directs it to the correct device.
If it’s meant for an external network (e.g., the internet), the router sends the packets to an ISP (Internet Service Provider), which routes them through a series of networks until they reach the destination.
### 1.3 Data Transmission (Wired or Wireless)
Packets travel over:
Wired networks (Ethernet, fiber optics) – Reliable and fast, commonly used in businesses.
Wireless networks (WiFi, cellular) – Convenient but prone to interference and slower speeds.
Each network device (router, switch, etc.) checks the packet's destination address and forwards it accordingly.
### 1.4 Packet Assembly at Destination
When packets arrive at the destination device, they are reassembled in the correct order. The receiving computer checks for missing or corrupted packets and requests re-transmission if needed.
### 1.5 Application Processing & Response
The received data is processed by the target application (e.g., a web browser displays a web page). If the request requires a response (e.g., sending an email), the process repeats in the reverse direction.
**Example**: Loading a Web page
You enter "google.com" in a browser.
The request is sent to a DNS server to find Google’s IP address.
Your browser sends packets to Google's server.
The server processes the request and sends back web page data in packets.
Your browser reassembles the packets and displays the web page.
## 2. TYPES OF NETWORKING 
### 2.1 LAN (Local Area Network)
– Covers a small area like a home, office, or school.
### 2.2 WAN (Wide Area Network) 
– Spans large areas, connecting multiple LANs (e.g., the internet).
### 2.3 MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)
– Covers a city or large campus.
### 2.4 PAN (Personal Area Network)
– Connects personal devices (e.g., Bluetooth, mobile hot spots).
## 3. IP ADDRESS
An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique identifier assigned to each device on a network, allowing it to communicate with other devices over the internet or a local network.
Think of an IP address like a home address—it tells data where to go and where it came from.

**TYPES OF IP ADDRESS** 
### 3.1 IPv4 (Internet Protocol Version 4)
Most common type, using a 32-bit address.
Written as four numbers (0-255) separated by dots (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
Limited to about 4.3 billion unique addresses, leading to shortages.
### 3.2 IPv6 (Internet Protocol Version 6)
Uses 128-bit addresses, allowing for trillions of addresses.
Written as eight groups of hexadecimal numbers (e.g., 2001:db8::ff00:42:8329).
Introduced to solve the IPv4 shortage and improve security.
### 3.3 Public IP Address
Assigned by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to your network.
Used to communicate with devices outside your local network (e.g., websites, online services).
Example: 203.0.113.5
### 3.4 Private IP Address
Used within a local network (LAN) (e.g., home Wi-Fi, office network).
Assigned by routers and not accessible from the internet directly.
Common private IP ranges:
192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255
10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255
172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255
### 3.5 Static IP Address
Fixed and does not change over time.
Used for hosting websites, remote access, and businesses.
Assigned manually or by an ISP.
### 3.6 Dynamic IP Address
Changes periodically, assigned by DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol).
Common for home internet users, reducing IP address shortages.
