## 1. PROTOCOL
A protocol is a set of rules that define how devices communicate over a network. It ensures that data is transmitted, received, and understood correctly between computers, servers, routers, and other devices.
Think of a protocol like a language—just as people need a common language to communicate, computers need networking protocols to exchange data efficiently.

**Types of Networking Protocols**
### 1.1 Communication Protocols (Data Transfer)
These protocols handle the transfer of data between devices:
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) – Ensures reliable, ordered, and error-checked data transmission.
UDP (User Data gram Protocol) – Faster but less reliable than TCP; used for streaming and gaming.
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) – Used for browsing websites (port 80).
HTTPS (HTTP Secure) – Encrypted version of HTTP for secure web browsing (port 443).
FTP (File Transfer Protocol) – Transfers files between computers (ports 20, 21).
### 1.2 Network Addressing & Routing Protocols
These protocols determine how data is directed across networks:
IP (Internet Protocol) – Identifies and locates devices using IP addresses (IPv4 & IPv6).
DNS (Domain Name System) – Converts domain names (e.g., google.com) into IP addresses.
DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) – Automatically assigns IP addresses to devices.
BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) – Helps routers find the best path for data across the internet.
### 1.3 Email Protocols
These protocols manage email sending and receiving:
SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) – Sends emails (port 25).
POP3 (Post Office Protocol v3) – Retrieves emails from a server (port 110).
IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) – Accesses emails while keeping them on the server (port 143).
### 1.4 Security & Encryption Protocols
These protocols protect data and prevent cyber threats:
SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer / Transport Layer Security) – Encrypts web traffic (used in HTTPS).
IPSec (Internet Protocol Security) – Secures data transfer over networks (VPNs).
SSH (Secure Shell) – Secure remote access to computers (port 22).
