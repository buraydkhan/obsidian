# Introduction to Kali Linux
**WHAT IS KALI LINUX** ?
Kali Linux is a Debian-based Linux distribution designed primarily for penetration testing, security auditing, and ethical hacking. It is developed and maintained by Offensive Security. The distribution comes pre-loaded with hundreds of security tools for penetration testing, forensics, reverse engineering, and digital forensics.
Kali Linux is a powerful, feature-rich security-focused OS. Whether you're an ethical hacker, cyber security professional, or researcher, it provides all the necessary tools for penetration testing and security auditing. However, it should be used responsibly and ethically.
## 1. Features
Kali Linux is widely used in cyber security due to its extensive feature set:
### 1.1 Pre-installed Security Tools
Kali Linux includes a vast number of tools for different security tasks, such as:
1. Penetration Testing: Metasploit, Nmap, Wireshark
2. Password Cracking: John the Ripper, Hashcat
3. Wireless Attacks: Aircrack-ng, Reaver
4. Reverse Engineering: Ghidra, Radare2
5. Exploitation Frameworks: Burp Suite, BeEF
6. Forensics Tools: Autopsy, Sleuth Kit
### 1.2 Customizability
Users can install only the required tools.
It supports multiple desktop environments like GNOME, XFCE, KDE, and i3.
Comes in different builds (e.g., full, light, and ARM versions).
### 1.3 Live Boot Capabilities
Can be run live from a USB drive without installation.
Features a persistence mode to save data between sessions.
### 1.4 ARM Support
Works on devices like Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone, and Android-based devices.
### 1.5 Frequent Updates & Rolling Releases
Kali follows a rolling release model, ensuring continuous updates.
Security tools are regularly updated to the latest versions.
### 1.6 Root & Non-root Modes
Earlier, Kali ran as root by default, but now it uses a non-root user model for security.
### 1.7 Documentation & Community Support
Official documentation is detailed and constantly updated.
Active community and support forums for troubleshooting.
## 2. Installing Kali Linux
There are multiple ways to install and run Kali Linux:
### 2.1 Live Boot (Without Installation)
Can run directly from a USB or DVD.
Good for testing without modifying the existing system.
### 2.2 Dual Boot
Allows running Kali Linux alongside Windows (or another OS).
Requires partitioning the hard drive.
### 2.3 Virtual Machine (VM)
Can be installed using VMware or VirtualBox.
Offers a safe environment without affecting the host OS.
### 2.4 Full Installation
Complete installation on a hard drive.
Best for dedicated penetration testing systems.
### 2.5 WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
Kali can be installed on Windows using WSL2 for limited penetration testing.

## 3. Basic Kali Linux Commands
Here are some essential commands used in Kali:
### 3.1 System Information
`uname -a          # Display system information`
`lsb_release -a    # Show Kali version`
`df -h             # Disk usage`
`free -m           # Memory usage`
### 3.2 Package Management
`sudo apt update          # Update package lists`
`sudo apt upgrade         # Upgrade all packages`
`sudo apt install <tool>  # Install a tool`
### 3.3 Network Commands
`ifconfig       # View network interfaces`
`iwconfig       # Wireless network information`
`netstat -tuln  # Show open ports`
`nmap <IP>      # Scan a target for open ports`
### 3.4 File Management
`ls -la         # List all files with permissions`
`cd <directory> # Change directory`
`cp <file> <destination>  # Copy a file`
`rm -rf <file>  # Delete file/folder permanently`

## 5. Popular Kali Linux Tools
### 5.1 Metasploit Framework
One of the most powerful penetration testing tools.
Used for exploiting vulnerabilities in systems.
### 5.2 Nmap
A network scanner for detecting devices and services.
Example usage:
`nmap -A <IP>`
### 5.3 Wireshark
A packet sniffer used for network traffic analysis.
### 5.4 Aircrack-ng
A wireless security tool used for Wi-Fi hacking.
### 5.5 Burp Suite
A web vulnerability scanner used for testing web applications.
### 5.6 John the Ripper
A password cracker used for testing password strength.
### 5.7 Hydra
A brute-force password-cracking tool.
## 6. Kali Linux Security & Ethical Use
Kali Linux is not illegal, but using it for hacking without permission is.
It is intended for ethical hacking, penetration testing, and cybersecurity research.
Always obtain proper authorization before testing any system.
## 7. Alternatives to Kali Linux
While Kali Linux is the most popular, there are other ethical hacking distributions:
Parrot OS – More privacy-focused, lighter than Kali.
BackBox – Debian-based, focuses on penetration testing.
BlackArch – Based on Arch Linux with thousands of security tools.
