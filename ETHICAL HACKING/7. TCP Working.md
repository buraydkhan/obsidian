# Introduction to TCP Working
| Names                 | Definitions                                                  |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| URG (Urgent)          | Data contained in the packed should be processed immediately |
| FIN (Finish)          | There will be no further transmission                        |
| RST (Rest)            | Resets a connection                                          |
| PSH (Push)            | Sends all buffered data immediately                          |
| ACK (Acknowledgement) | Acknowledges the receipt of package                          |
| SYN (Synchronize)     | Initiates a connection between hosts                         |
## 1. TCP Three way handshake
The TCP three-way handshake is the process used to establish a reliable connection between a client and a server before data transmission begins. It consists of three steps:
### 1.1 SYN (Synchronize)
The client sends a TCP segment with the SYN flag set, indicating a request to establish a connection.
It includes an initial sequence number (ISN) for tracking the communication.
### 1.2 SYN-ACK (Synchronize-Acknowledge)
The server responds with a SYN-ACK packet, acknowledging the client‚Äôs SYN.
It also includes its own ISN for the session.
### 1.3 ACK (Acknowledge)
The client sends an ACK packet back to the server, confirming receipt of the SYN-ACK.
The connection is now established, and data transmission can begin.

  | SYN  -------->  |
  | <---- SYN-ACK  |
  | ACK  -------->  |
Connection Established ‚úÖ`

This handshake ensures both parties are synchronized before exchanging data, providing reliability in TCP communication.

## 2. TCP Session Termination
**WHAT IS TCP SESSION TERMINATION** ?
To gracefully close a TCP connection, a four-step termination process is followed, ensuring that both parties properly end the communication.

### 2.1 FIN (Finish) ‚Üí
The client (or server) sends a FIN packet to indicate it has finished sending data.
### 2.2 ACK (Acknowledge) ‚Üê
The receiving side acknowledges the FIN by sending an ACK packet.
The connection remains half-open (one side can still send data).
### 2.3 FIN (Finish) ‚Üê
The other side now sends its own FIN to indicate that it also wants to close the connection.
### 2.4 ACK (Acknowledge) ‚Üí
The initiator sends an ACK to confirm receipt of the second FIN.
The connection is fully closed after a timeout (called TIME_WAIT) to ensure delayed packets don‚Äôt interfere with a future connection.

## 3. TCP vs. UDP
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are two major transport layer protocols. Here‚Äôs how they compare:

| FEATURE         | TCP (TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL )                                                                       | UDP (USER DATA GRAM PROTOCOL)                                                            |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CONNECTION TYPE | CONNECTION ORIENTATED (REQUIRES HANDSHAKE)                                                                 | CONNECTION LESS (NO HANDSHAKE)                                                           |
| RELAIBILITY     | RELIABLE (ENSURES DATA SAFETY)                                                                             | UNRELIABLE (NO GUARANTEE)                                                                |
| ERROR CHECKING  | USES ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS,RE TRANSMISSIONS AND SEQUENCE NUMBERS                                                | USES BASIC CHECKSUM (NO RE TRANSMISSION)                                                 |
| SPEED           | SLOWER DUE TO ERROR CONNECTION AND RELIABILITY                                                             | FASTER DUE TO NO OVERHEAD                                                                |
| DATA ORDERING   | ENSURES CORRECT ORDERS OF PACKETS                                                                          | NO GUARANTEE ORDER OF PACKETS                                                            |
| OVERHEAD        | HIGH (DUE TO HIGH ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS AND HANDSHAKES)                                                         | LOW (NO EXTRA CONTROL MESSAGES)                                                          |
| USE CASES       | Web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS), Email (SMTP, IMAP), File transfer (FTP), Streaming (when reliability is needed) | Gaming, VoIP, Live Streaming, DNS, DHCP (where speed is more important than reliability) |
**Analogy**:
TCP is like a phone call üìû ‚Üí You confirm the connection, ensure all words are heard in the correct order, and retransmit if needed.
UDP is like a text message üì© ‚Üí It‚Äôs sent without checking if the receiver got it or received it in order.
